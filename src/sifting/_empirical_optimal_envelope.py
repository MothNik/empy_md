Module :mod:`sifting._empirical_optimal_envelope`

This module implements the empirical optimal envelope extraction algorithm. It is an
algorithm that aims for obtaining an envelope that does not show the over- and
undershoots that are present in the upper and lower envelopes obtained by the cubic
spline interpolation of the maxima and minima of the signal.

    Notes
    -----
    The Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is a signal that is defined as the mean of its
    lower and upper empirical optimal envelope.
    In contrary to the simple sifting algorithm where the envelopes are obtained by
    interpolation of the maxima and minima of the signal, the empirical optimal envelope
    algorithm iteratively refines the interpolation by moving the interpolation base
    points to make them tangent to the signal. This way, the over- and undershoots that
    the interpolation might introduce are minimised.
